# Title of Project: Leveraging Machine Learning for COVID-19 Diagnosis

## Team Members:
1. Mansi
2. Nandini Vashistha

## Steps for Execution:

1. Data Preprocessing
    Load the X-ray image dataset.
    Resize images to a fixed size.
    Normalize pixel values.
    Encode labels (COVID-19, NonCOVID-19).

2. Feature Extraction using PCA
    Flatten image data if needed.
    Apply various methods to reduce dimensionality.
   
3. Model Building using ResNet
    Build a Residual Network (ResNet) architecture using Keras/TensorFlow.

4. Training
    Compile the model with loss.
    Train using model.fit() with proper epochs and batch size.

5. Evaluation
    Evaluate on test set using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
    Plot confusion matrix and ROC curve.

6. Results
    Final model accuracy: 95%
    Model successfully distinguishes COVID from normal with high precision.
